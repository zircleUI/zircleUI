**What issues can I inform?**
This section is for informing a **bug**. If you want to propose **features, ideas, etc.**, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/zircleUI/zircleUI/discussions). 

You can also open an issue if the **documentation** is not clear enough.

**How to inform?**
Just try to explain **what happens** and **what is expected to happen** . Also, it would very useful to provide **a way to reproduce the issue** (JSFiddle, CodePen, CodeSandbox or provide a GitHub repo).
